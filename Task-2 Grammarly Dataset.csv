f_XVxYjmWj8,"Some of the challenges with notion that made me consider alternatives. A lot of it had to do with pricing going up and my team using less and less of those features. What I was looking for was to have a tool where members of my team would be empowered to make updates within their own departments without having to pay for a seat for every single person who makes updates. The migration process from notion was very seamless. It didn't require any further editing from me. So, if that hadn't been the case, it might have taken me longer to make a decision. But that sold it for me. Using Kod and Grammarly together, it's just a beautiful marriage of two tools for two work processes that are so important to my business. I can create really clear documentation. and I can catch any errors and ensure our brand style guide is implemented even in how we talk about clients and their products."

I can catch any errors and ensure our brand style guide is implemented even in how we talk about clients and their products. Hi, my name is Maddie Osman. I am the founder of the Blogsmith content agency for B2B technology brands. I was looking for a tool where members of my team would be empowered to make updates within their own departments without having to pay for a seat for every single person who makes updates. In KOD, you're only paying for the user who creates the initial documents. From there, other team members are able to edit those documents without me needing to add paid seats for the privilege. KOD empowers team members with the information that they need in order to complete their task. Whether it's client specific information, their persona documentation, and standard operating procedures. With Grammarly, we make use of the custom style guide to make it really straightforward for my team to be on the same page and not waste a lot of time on unnecessary edits. With Grammarly and KOD, my team is finally able to have an effective single point of truth for both our style rules and the essential processes that underly our content creation. [Music]"
O0qdEu7VjDs,"The biggest benefit of using Grammarly in my work is that it helps me be the best writer that I can be so that I can be an effective partner for my clients. My name is Alyssa Towns and I'm a freelance writer at Words with Alyssa LLC. Prior to working with Grammarly, and I don't think I realized it at the time, my writing just wasn't always super clear. Looking back, I realized that Grammarly was not only improving my writing, but also helping me become a better and stronger writer, too. Grammarly has analyzed over 25 million words since I started using it over 5 years ago. And it's helped me maintain long-term relationships with my clients, provide high quality work to them, and prior to freelancing. It's really helped me succeed as an internal communications professional. I use paragraph rewrites, clarity suggestions, and proofreading the most in Grammarly because my secret sauce is getting that first draft down on paper, getting those initial thoughts out, and then using Grammarly to really bring it to life, clean it up, and turn it into the best version that it can be. My favorite way to use Grammarly's AI feature is to generate a starting point for longer communications to get that first draft out so that I can focus on the more strategic pieces of the communication itself. No matter your role in communications or what type of work you do, Grammarly works wherever you work and caters to you to help you be the best, most effective communicator that you can be."
WpRFs0gUYRs,"If I were to speak to my past self before using Grammarly, I would say, imagine having a personal writing assistant that not only catches embarrassing mistakes before hitting send, but also helps you articulate your ideas clearly and improves your writing skills every time you use it. My name is Stacy Rashan. I'm an educational technology consultant and author. Grammarly's AI makes me a more confident writer. With its assistance, I'm able to craft clear and more effective messages. Those who use Grammarly know it's a superstar in helping you strike the right tone, and I love the ease with which you can toggle between more friendly and more formal tones effortlessly with some of Grammarly's newer features. My favorite new Grammarly feature is paragraph rewrite. While Grammarly was great at catching errors and suggesting improvements in the past, paragraph rewrites have really taken everything up several notches. To me, it almost feels like I used to have a copy editor with Grammarly, and now I have a line editor, an assistant that improves the overall structure, flow, and coherence of my writing. I also just love the implementation of the paragraph rewrites. It's such a natural flow. I simply tap the sidebar to see suggestions there in line. I can undo any changes that I don't feel right and then I can choose to accept and continue on. I never hit send on a post without checking with Grammarly first. Grammarly will make you a more confident and effective communicator and truly helps you develop as a writer while maintaining your personal style."

1_ZczeKkduA,"Welcome to your Grammarly admin video series. As an account admin, you play a key role in setting your team up for success. These quick videos will show you how to activate Grammarly's most powerful features so your team can write with clarity, consistency, and confidence from day one. In this video, we'll show you how to set up brand tones and style rules. Two features that tailor Grammarly suggestions to match your brand's unique voice and writing standards. You are setting the tone for your entire team and we're here to make that easier. Let's start with brand tones. Teams spend countless hours manually ensuring their brand is consistently represented. What if that effort was automated? Whether your brand is casual and friendly or polished and professional, Grammarly helps reinforce that voice everywhere your team writes. You can designate brand tones that guide your team to strike the right note in every message. To get started, head to the admin panel and begin setting up your team's tone profile. We'll walk you through a few quick questions about how your brand sounds. Things like how formal, optimistic, or direct your voice should be. From there, Grammarly generates a custom tone profile based on your responses. You can fine-tune it further by searching for, adding, or removing tones so it reflects exactly how you want your team to sound across different channels. Once you've saved your settings, these tones will instantly start informing your team's writing, providing real-time tone suggestions that help them stay on brand. Next up, style rules. Through this feature, you can define how your team should refer to key terms, follow inclusive language and compliance standards, or avoid off-brand language. For example, if your team should always use full product names in external messages, never acronyms or abbreviations, you can set that as a rule that will surface and correct them as they write. To create a new rule, head to the style rules tab in the admin panel. From there, you can add individual rules or upload a list of all of your rules at once. You can add explanations for each rule so your team understands the context behind the suggestions. And you can even share a link for team members to learn more. Grammarly surfaces these rules in real time so your team gets brand specific writing guidance exactly when they need it. Once everything's set, tone and style suggestions appear automatically across your team's everyday tools like Google Docs, KOD, email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and more. It's an easy way to keep your brand voice strong and your team aligned. No extra effort or training required. Grammarly's AI assistant for work is here to support your team and help your brand shine through and every word. Ready to get started? Head to the admin panel to set up brand tones and style rules today."
CNDU5v7B_FU,"[Music] Welcome back to your Grammarly admin video series. In this video, you'll learn how to invite users to Grammarly using a variety of methods from quick manual invites to more automated and secure options that integrate with your internal systems. No matter how your organization is set up, we've got you covered. Let's start with single signon or SSO. SSO allows your team to log into Grammarly using your preferred identity provider like Octa or Microsoft Entra ID. It keeps things easy for your team with no extra passwords to remember and gives your IT team greater control over access and security. To set it up, you or your IT team will first need to add Grammarly to your identity provider. From there, fill in the authentication fields in your Grammarly admin panel. test the connection and then activate it for your team. Once SSO is live, you'll get a custom login link you can share with your team to get them started. Next is SKIM provisioning which is available only on enterprise plans. SKIM stands for system for cross-domain identity management. But more importantly, it's one of the most secure and automated ways to manage user access. For example, you can give every new hire access to Grammarly the moment they join and they'll receive an invite. When skimm is enabled, new users are automatically provision based on rules you define in your identity provider. No manual steps required. If you're ready to set this up, reach out to our support team or your Grammarly account representative. We'll walk you through it. You can also invite users directly from the admin panel. Navigate to the members tab under member management and choose how you want to invite them. You can add emails manually one by one. Upload a list to add emails in bulk or copy and share an invite link. If you're already using SSO, users invited this way will simply be redirected to your SSO login page and access will only be granted if Grammarly is assigned to them through your identity provider. Once set up, admins can manage user roles and permissions anytime. Here are a few different types of users you can assign. Other account admins like you who should have full access to IT configurations, billing, and more. Account managers who can configure writing settings across teams and view usage data across the company. and users who receive writing suggestions and can view their analytics but can't make account changes. On enterprise plans, you can also set up custom roles with the exact permissions you need for each. Whether you're inviting a few teammates or rolling out Grammarly across your entire organization, you have flexible options that give you control, security, and scalability. If you need help at any time, visit our help center or contact your Grammarly account team. We're here to help. Ready to get started? Head to the admin panel and invite your team today."
5wmTbiiaIuU,"[Music] Welcome back to your Grammarly admin video series. In this video, we're covering a key feature available to customers on our enterprise plan, the effective communication score or ECS. Your ECS helps you understand how strong your organization's communication is by analyzing your team's activity in Grammarly and comparing it to industry benchmarks. It's a simple way to capture the impact of Grammarly and get insight into the quality of your organization's communication. Let's walk through how to read your score and how to improve it over time. To get started, head to the team overview. Under the analytics tab within your admin panel, at the top, you'll see your organization's ECS, and just below it, you'll see what your team's score would have been without Grammarly. You'll also see a breakdown of how Grammarly has improved different aspects of your team's communication like correctness, clarity, inclusivity, style consistency, and brand compliance based on the suggestions that your team has accepted. Click on your detailed score analysis to learn how the score is calculated, how to interpret it, and how you stack up against others in your industry. This analysis gives you a more actionable picture of what Grammarly is improving and where there's opportunity to grow. For example, if your style consistency score is lower than you expect, it may be time to update and reinforce your brand style guide within Grammarly. Which brings me to a few quick ways to raise your score. Set up brand tones within Grammarly to guide your team's tone in real time and improve brand compliance across your org. Create style rules to align on preferred terms and formatting, raising your style consistency score. Invite teammates to Grammarly and streamline access by enabling single sign on to ensure everyone is communicating more clearly and accurately.

q2jR6PmLOqU,"[Music] Welcome back to your Grammarly admin video series. In this video, you'll learn how to save your team time and reduce repetitive work using two powerful tools, snippets and knowledge share. Together, they help your team access company knowledge so they can stay aligned and avoid confusion without breaking their flow. Let's start with snippets. Snippets are reusable blocks of text that your team can insert instantly using a simple keyboard shortcut instead of typing it out every time. You can create snippets for things like common customer responses, product descriptions, your brand's boilerplate, or internal updates you send on a regular basis. While each user can always create their own snippets, admins can scale this time-saving feature by creating and managing snippets at the account level to ensure everyone has access to company approved messaging. To set these up, go to the snippets tab in your admin panel. You can add snippets in two ways. Upload them in bulk using a CSV template or add them one by one just like you would with style rules. Each snippet includes a title, shortcut, and body text, which can be a few words, a sentence, or even an entire paragraph complete with links. You can always preview or edit your snippets later. Want to personalize these even further? You can assign snippets to specific groups of users with collections, so sales, support, and marketing each get what they need without extra noise. This level of customization makes it easy to support every team with relevant, reusable content. Once snippets are live, your team can use them anywhere they write. Just type the backslash key to search and insert a snippet instantly. No more copy pasting or rewriting the same message twice. Snippets help your team move faster, write smarter, and stay consistent without the extra effort. Next up, knowledge share. An easy way to reduce confusion around acronyms and team jargon. When enabled, Grammarly will automatically detect jargon in your team's writing. Users can hover over a term to see its definition, related documents, and who to contact for more context. This keeps communication clear and gives new teammates or crossfunctional collaborators easy access to information. To add terms, head to the knowledge share tab in your admin panel. From there, you can add individual terms or upload a list of all of the terms your team should know at once. You'll also find collections of preset terms you can choose from for specific industries and teams. Within each term, add a description that defines the term or acronym and link supporting materials like documentation or Slack channels. You can also assign ownership to subject matter experts so your team always knows who to contact to learn more. Once your terms are uploaded, Grammarly will automatically highlight them across the tools your team uses every day. Just make sure your team downloads Grammarly for Chrome and Grammarly for Windows or Mac to take full advantage of these features. That way, all they need to do is hover over a term to get instant clarity. Snippets and knowledge share help your team move faster, write smarter, and stay aligned without slowing down to search, retype, or clarify. Ready to save your team time? Head to your admin panel to set up snippets and knowledge share today."

trip with my best friend Gabbie. Luckily, I write with Grammarly. What once took me hours now takes minutes. So I can focus on what matters most, my voice. We begin in Ancient Egypt and then the Renaissance, but also Impressionism. And of course, the internet. - Hey. 
- Hey. Have you started packing? Totally. I have not. Finish that paper, you got this. Thank you. - Bye.
- Bye. OK, back to it. Time to double-check my facts and citations. Oops, I made a few debated claims. Fixing those. Nice! No more embarrassing mistakes... But what kind of grade are we talking here?

N9afgFkfV1w,"[Music] Okay. >> Ready? >> Okay. Hi. So, Grammarly is a company that helps over 40 million people, including me, become better and more effective communicators. And over the past year, I know that Grammarly has leaned into generative AI to further this goal. You've launched tools like authorship, which helps users differentiate between user generated and human content, and prompting tools to help users better tailor what they're writing. So, I'm especially excited to chat with you uh on what business leaders can learn about Grammarly's AI strategy. Shashir is the new CEO of Grammarly. He recently stepped into the role. Um and before that he was the founder of productivity tool KOD and he was also responsible for leading YouTube at Google and several other tech companies uh including working at Microsoft. So Grammarly recently acquired Koda a productivity tool. Can you give us context on how that happened and what's next for Grammarly? >> Yeah, excited to be here. Uh first human X conference. Fun place to be. Um yes, so we we uh combined companies uh about two months ago now uh Emily and Kota and it all started with a really interesting meeting between the the two leadership teams where we realized our vision for the future was an interesting mixed um almost like two puzzle pieces fitting together. Um and we had this meeting in Vancouver. We sat down. We learned a lot about each other's strategies. You know, first thing I learned was Gramly is a lot bigger and different than people think. You know, Grammarly, as Luxie mentioned, 40 million daily active users use Grammarly every day to help them communicate better. It's a pretty large business, over $700 million in in revenue. Uh, that's often surprising people, but the most surprising thing about Grammarly is that the actual uh innovation has very little to do with the grammar. The heart of what Grammarly has actually built is a technology stack to bring AI agents right to where the user works. If you think about what Grammarly does in 500,000 different applications in the uh on the web, on the desktop, so on, Grammarly can read what you're doing, annotate it, and uh and change it for anything from Google Docs to Slack to Salesforce, so on. One of the analogies that the Gramly founders gave me that I really liked is that it feels like uh Grammarly built this AI superighway where we can bring agents right to the edge, but we're only running one car on that highway today. We're only running the one with your English grammar teacher in it. And part of what we wanted to do together was bring what Grammarly and Kota had been doing to fill those cars with the rest of the agents. You know, one of the things KOD is very well known for is integrating with all the different products in the world. It's one of the most popular features of Kod. And that's the sort of core idea of what we're doing is building the AI superighway to bring agents to the edge and making it possible for anybody to deploy an agent that works right alongside humans. >> Awesome. So the launch of chat GPT is considered a seminal moment in the present AI revolution. Through your experience at YouTube, Koda and now Grammarly, you've seen AI through many generations. Can you talk a little bit more about what this moment signified for you? >> Yeah, I mean it's very interesting. Obviously everybody here is sees the excitement the same way. uh you know I started my career working on the cloud uh while I was at Microsoft while that transition was happening that was amazing I then worked on YouTube when people thought what we were seeing was the video revolution but actually what we were seeing was the maker revolution that was really interesting and I spent the last 10 years working in productivity with Koda and Grammarly and I I think what we're seeing now is a dramatic shift in productivity I like to think of as the third era of productivity so maybe if you follow with me the uh you can think about productivity as three phases first phase was uh digitization. That's when we took typewriters and turned them into word processors and basically went from physical tools to digital ones. And then about 15 years ago, we went through the second era of productivity where productivity became about collaboration, about working with humans. So it went from single player to multiplayer. We saw products like Google Docs. We saw products like Slack and all these products that really took uh made it possible to work with your teammates in your in your productivity tools. And I think in this phase we're about to take the next leap and we're going to go from working with humans to working with humans and agents. And I think that's really exciting way uh uh to think about it. One one visual that that might help is today if you open any of your productivity products, Google Docs, Koda, so on, you'll see all the avatars at the top, right? Those are the those are the people you work with. Imagine a future where in all those tools, instead of having the four or five teammates you work with, you have the four or 5,000 agents that are helping you and your team be productive. And I think that's the way I like to think about productivity is we're embracing a world where our productivity tools are going to help humans and AI work together to solve problems. >> Okay, that's a great segue into my next question, which is about AI in the productivity space. Um, how do you see grammar release tools evolving and what have you already seen from users that's surprised you? >> What surprises? So, I think probably the most interesting surprise is there's so much AI hype and everybody's deploying lots of different tools, but it's an amazing amount of shelfware. It's an amazing amount of people buying things that actually don't get used, don't actually produce impact. And I think one of the main reasons for that is people are forgetting the core lesson that you need to bring AI to the user instead of the other way around. So there's lots of tools being deployed that require users to change their behavior instead of working alongside them. And that's obviously a key part of what we're what we do at Grammarly is we bring AI to the user instead of the other way around. And it has a pretty dramatic impact on on productivity. I think it's a space where measuring that can be really hard. And so one of the things I was really excited about is the team came up with this idea. It's a fairly creative idea for how to measure the impact AI is having on a company. So we built a thing we call ROI reports. It's very easy one for any anybody to uh do. Uh we ran it with a number of companies. So a lot of our customers Smart Sheet, Indeed, Data Brick, so on. And the way it works is we basically run an AV test on a company. So we take the Grammarly products and we deploy it to everybody. But for half of them they get real suggestions and for the other half we sort of suppress it and then we measure the impact on productivity based on whatever the company is trying to achieve. And the results were pretty stunning. If you bring AI to the user you get this dramatic impact and its ability to have real impact uh on on on those users and teams. One fun stat, the average um time saved for people in these studies is about 19 days per year. So if you use the Gramly tool set and bring it right to the user, your people will get 19 days a year back in time. So I think this is really important that as we deploy AI, there's lots of hype. We need to deploy it in a way that actually works the way people work and then measure its impact on what it's doing for people. >> Awesome. Um, now in 2025, agents are the biggest buzzword. What does this term mean to you and Grammarly? >> Yeah, so agents I I think everyone here has a different definition of agents. So I'll just share my my way of thinking about it. Um, I like to call agents virtual collaborators. So based on the third era of AI, I think of agents as the the sort of virtual teammates that you can work with. And if you go one click deeper, I think of agents as having uh three things. knowledge, skills and assignments. So knowledge is the set of things they know. So for example, the Grammarly agent knows every rule of the English uh grammar language. Skills are things they can do. So an agent might be able like Grammarly to annotate and edit the the content you're working on. They might be able to take actions on your behalf. It can send an email. It can start an order. Uh can ship something to someone. And then finally is assignments. So I I my view is that you should be able to take agents and hand them assignments. The assignment might be as simple as sit next to me and help me communicate better or as complicated as reach out to every customer and make sure they get a personalized uh personalized outreach to maybe to come to an event or so on. So with that in mind, you can see an incredibly wide set of uh of agents and so maybe I'll give a few examples of ones that I you know in sort of my dreamscape of what I think people are going to see. Um so some agents will differentiate on knowledge. So, for example, uh some of the more popular agents that we're building today are ones that connect with other systems. So, you're going to have agents that connect to Salesforce or Jira or so on. And now when you sit down to write, you're writing your customer memo, you have your your agent that is your English grammar teacher helping make sure you communicate well. But you also have the agent that says, ""I know what this uh what's happening with this customer because I can read Salesforce and I can help you fill in this information."" or when you're trying to promise a feature, you can say, well, I've I've already read what's happening in Jira and I can tell you the correct date that this will come out or the correct positioning from the product marketing team. So, some agents will be about changing that kind of knowledge. Another type might be agents that sort of uplevel into what I what you might think of as coaches. You know, maybe as another example, every sales team has a methodology as you know, some sales teams run with something called medic uh or lots of different methodologies. Imagine every one of those instead of being tutorials and instructions, they became agents that work alongside you and they help your salespeople actually follow the principles of those uh philosophies. That might extend to things like um I I'm really excited about book authors. I think every book author today produces a book that you read and then put in the back of your head. One of my favorite examples is uh I love the book Radical Cander from Kim Scott. And I'm I'm sure for everyone here who's read that, you'll read it and try to follow the guidance. But imagine that Kim didn't just give you a book. Imagine she gave you an agent that sat and watched you work and said, ""You are or aren't following the philosophy of the book."" Maybe one last example, and this one might seem the the craziest, but it was one of the most fun ones. It's having a conversation with the team at Duolingo, and we're just talking about what would it mean for Dolingo to be an agent. Right now, you probably think of Dolingo as an application. Imagine instead that everywhere you worked, your Dualingo agent came with you and it said, uh, you know, you you want to maintain your streak. Instead of going to the app, how about you read three articles today in Spanish? Or maybe while you're reading in English, it can help quiz you a bit on what would this be in Spanish? Or maybe the other way around. While you're reading in Spanish, it can translate the words that you don't know, but let you figure out the ones you should know. And then when you come back to that application, you come back to that agent, it might know what you're trying to go through and say, ""Today's lesson, instead of focusing on how to order food at a restaurant, we're going to focus on how to buy um uh how to buy a house or how to buy a company or whatever it might be."" So that's how I think about agents is, you know, we're going to take knowledge, skills, and assignments, and then it's up to people's dreams of what they can do with those agents. So I think there's lots of things, lots of exciting things coming. >> Yeah. But you know, as a journalist who is using AI tools, one concern I have is that we're entering a world where communication is becoming increasingly automated. How is Grammarly thinking about preserving human authenticity in this environment? >> Yeah. Are we all going to turn into robots or could we still stay still stay humans? I mean, I think this is very core to how Grammarly thinks about AI. I mean, Grammarly at sort of its heart is a user- centric AI company. We we give suggestions to people and those people then take those actions. Right? This is this is help for you to communicate better. And so it's very important that the human is in the loop. It's very important that that each of those suggestions matches the style of the person. It's we want each person to be a better version of themselves, not all be the same way, communicating with the same tone, with the same words, the same insights to be a very boring place uh to to go and live. And I think this idea extends into a lot of our products. And one one one uh one feature launch you mentioned recently was something we did called authorship. Um maybe I'll explain what authorship is um there's a very surprising insight. So uh a large portion of the Gramly audience is is students. It's about a third of the audience and for those uh for those users their challenge with authenticity is sort of sort of existential. And so very simple reason, you know, as students trying to prove to their professor they actually wrote the paper. And so they have this challenge of using AI in ways that are helpful but still staying authentic to to who they are. So we decided to build an agent we call the authorship agent that sort of reverses everything and gives a score as you're writing for how much um how authentic it is to you versus how much AI it is. uh it just watches what you're doing and comes back with a score that then your professor can see that says this paper was written 80% by you and 20% by AI or maybe it's 20% and 80% whatever the goal might be and we're seeing hundreds of schools adopt it and instruct students this is how you can responsibly use AI in a way that allows you to stay authentic but also uh um uh use AI for the for the tools it's uh it's best for so that's a a good example but it's very central to how we Think about it. Our goal is to think of AI or AI agents as collaborators, not replacement for those humans. >> Yeah. Um, and so those that work with you know that you have a focus on rituals. And I hear that you're writing a book called The Rituals of Great Teams as you integrate into your new role. How are you thinking about corporate culture? >> Yeah, it's pretty uh pretty fun topic for me. I I don't know if everybody else feels the same way. I have lots of normal hobbies, but I I found this this this interesting one in collecting rituals. And maybe I'll tell you a little story of where it came from. The um uh I was having a conversation uh with a friend of mine, Bing Gordon. So, Bing, if people don't know him, he was the chief creative officer at Electronic Arts. He's now a famous investor, um Amazon, Zingga, uh you know, hundreds of other companies. and he and I sat on a board together and he was sort of harassing the CEO with this question. He said, ""What are your golden rituals?"" And the CEO was a little flustered and said, ""Uh, I don't Bing, I don't know what you mean."" And so Bing Bing said, ""Oh, well, every great company has a small list of golden rituals and they all meet these three tests."" And he had a very clear list of three tests. So the three tests are um uh the if you think about golden rituals the three tests are uh they are named uh number one number two every employee knows them by their first Friday and number three they're templated the interesting way to think about rituals and he and he proceeded to say if you want to be a great company you need to have your list of golden rituals and he rattled off some of the examples from different companies Amazon does six pages Google does OKRs Salesforce does V2 Um, and we had this whole discussion about the rituals of those uh of those companies. Um, I got really excited about this idea. I started talking about it whenever I whenever I could. Started talking about with friends at other companies. And over the course of the last three or four years, I've turned it into my side project writing this book called Rituals of Great Teams. Easy to find rituals of great teams.com. the um I've interviewed about a thousand or so uh founders, entrepreneurs, you know, authors, so on to just collect up rituals from all the best companies in the world and try to categorize them into uh into a set that people can actually use. Maybe one one um one fun story from those interviews. I was talking to uh Dermesh. Der is the uh founder of HubSpot and the ritual he contributed to the book is called flashtags. It's a way to communicate to indicate severity of of your opinions on topics. But his actual uh more interesting insight was he said Shashir the reason he's so excited about the reason I'm so excited about rituals he said the uh I think that as companies we misunderstand what we're building as companies we're actually building two products one product for our customers that's what they all use in his case it's HubSpot and we're building a whole other product for the company itself it's the product that builds the product and he said the thing when people ask about that second product they'll often describe it as culture but if you ask people to describe culture, they will they will culture manifests as rituals. And so he said by paying attention to rituals, what you're actually doing is putting the same amount of thought into the product for your customers as you are the product for for your teams. So anyways, it's it's been a very interesting journey to get to learn about rituals and of course I'm in this unique position now of combining two companies, Grammarly and KOD, and we're going through this really interesting process of taking all the rituals from both companies and selectively applying them. sometimes taking the Gramly ritual, sometimes taking the cod ritual, sometimes coming up with a brand new ritual. And we've done a number of them. Everything from how you take make decisions, how you do planning, how you hire people. And I think that idea of build the product that that builds the product is a really powerful way to think about what we do in our companies. >> Amazing. And uh looking ahead, I'm wondering what untapped opportunities in workplace productivity is Grammarly poised to address. You know, I I think this idea of supercharging humans with agents. I I think it's a really provocative way to think about what what we're going through. I think a lot of a lot of people look at AI as a threat. I think I look at AI the opposite way. We're about to give every person 10,000 interns and they're great. They're s they're you know, if you think about uh these folks, they never disagree with each other. you know don't you know they'll follow your instructions but it's also this amazing challenge right now you know you take the average person who's maybe never been a manager before they say now you have 10,000 people to manage and I think that idea of rethinking what how we think about AI and productivity it's not really about replacing anybody about turning us all into scaled managers and I think that that frame is it's it's much more exciting but it's also gives you this challenge how are you going to take these people how are you going to train them, how you going to give them better instructions, how you going to audit what they're doing and making sure it works well. But I think that's the exciting mission that we're working on now. >> Amazing. Thank you. >> Yeah, I think we're right at time."
i6l1Ai_gc68,"I've been using Grammarly for many years now, but if you had told me back then what Grammarly could do now, that'd be pretty mind-blowing. It's a tool that makes our lives easier, and it just continually iterates and improves. Making sure that you stay ahead of the curve is truly important, and this is the way to do it is with a tool like Grammarly. I'm a manager of design operations at Procore Technologies. One of the critical pieces of my role is change management. People can resist change and so how do you approach that? And this is where Grammarly has been really helpful. Having an AI teammate like Grammarly is really beneficial with making sure that we're getting the information across succinctly, making sure that the tone of voice is what we want and what will be best received by the individuals who will be reading the messaging. Thing that I really love the most about Grammarly is how it's literally my writing assistant. It follows me around everywhere I go and it has really helped me be more efficient in the work that I do. And that to me is the most important part is being able to make sure that I'm staying focused on what I'm doing and I don't have to, you know, start looking elsewhere to figure out things. It really just helps me be a better communicator, which is really like a big portion of my job. That to me is the way AI works. I don't want to have to dig around for it and spend more time working with the AI. And Grammarly is the exact opposite. It's always there when I need it and it's always there to help me through all the tasks that I do daily. [Music]"
tBRPf3a6a8s,"Grammarly's AI has changed how I communicate across different platforms and tools. Honestly, it's like having a writing coach with me 24/7. Whether I'm sending an email to a customer, interacting with colleagues in Slack, Grammarly keeps my tone on point and my message is very clear. My name is Chanel Jamal. I'm a customer success professional. permanent AI has helped me maintain my voice and raise my confidence. Most recently, I had to send a follow-up email to a tricky customer who was at risk. I didn't want to come across too harsh or too soft, and Grammarly helped me tweak the tone of my email just right. One new Grammarly feature that I find most useful is the paragraph rewrite. Trust me, this is everything. Sometimes I'll write the paragraph and I can see that it's clunky, but I just couldn't see how to fix it. Grammarly's AI assistant steps in, tidies it up, and boom, it's clean, it's professional, but most importantly, it sounds just like me. Just last week, I had 10 minutes in between my client calls and needed to send a document to an executive team. What I did was to draft my ideas and ask Grammarly AI to make them informative and more detailed. This was like magic. In a matter of seconds, I had a wow document. Grammarly saves you brain power, keeps your tone in check, and makes you sound like a true professional even when you're just running on coffee."

Kota was one of the probably first products that I remember coming into Zapier and just loving that the company used. Kota plays a pretty critical role in helping Zapier have crossunctional collaboration. I manage a team of nine people and as a tool KOD is really important for me for visibility and transparency. We use KOD on the marketing team as a central hub for information. So anyone at the company can go into the KODOD and to see the marketing strategy. They can see all of our planning documents and then they also have visibility into what I'm working on as well as their teammates. So it's a really nice two-way street. >> One of the biggest things that helps us is actually Kod's rich set of APIs. You've seen teams adapt KOD to be really customizable. One of the ways that we've been able to build really powerful AI systems because we use KOD is by connecting KOD automation and our own Zapier to be able to get models aware of content from what our projects are, what our teams are working on. We don't have private Slack channels. Everything is out in the open and that includes our async communication.

9FhPaxfRO4Y,"Is it possible to get a job in 24 hours? So, I was curious how quickly I could get a job. And so, rather than focusing my efforts on networking and building out a resume, I decided to start by cold emailing and DMing a bunch of different companies to see if they would hire me. Now, things were not looking good in the first couple of hours because despite literally messaging dozens of places, I wasn't getting any responses. But then it hit me. It was probably because my messages were pretty unprofessional, looking like this. In my quest for quantity, I ended up sacrificing quality. But I didn't have time to sit down and appropriately curate a professional and personalized message to each of them. But luckily, Grammarly exists, which is an AI writing assistant that helps you write better and faster to optimize for your work. And since they have a keyboard app and a desktop app, you can write on the go no matter where you are. The best part, though, is you could tailor your writing based on whoever you're talking to.

If you think that citations take up too much time, then there is an auto citation tool that appears when you have the extension installed. But if you upgrade to Grammarly Pro, you get access to tools that can help you turn wordy sentences into clear, effective ones, or even a plagiarism tracker if your university is really strict on that.

G4dSAzJRdJI,"Let's write my cover letter together. Okay, so this is what I had before. I am looking to gain legal experience and guidance at any capacity. My goal is to learn as much as possible to navigate the legal industry with as much competence and understanding as possible. Terrible, awful, embarrassing.

Post Grammarly driven by a sincere enthusiasm for gaining knowledge and experience. I'm eager to explore any opportunities that will allow me to learn."" And girls, yes, Grammarly has given me a 98 overall score. I think this has removed like 25 filler words that I just didn't know I had. It sounds so much better.

1sGEN6Vobc0,"At some point in your job search, it is pretty inevitable that you'll be asked, ""Why are you leaving your current role?"" As annoying as this question is, they're asking this to gauge your motivations and make sure you're not going to cause strife or bail as soon as you get a higher job offer. And even though you're really leaving because you're bored out of your mind and you're underpaid and your manager actually drinks toxic juice for breakfast, now is not the time for honesty hour.

And with the help of Grammarly's AI features, we can pick that massive list of all the reasons you are ready to move on from your job and turn it into professional forwardlooking motivations.

iyTwKibn_ds,"- Hey, it's Grammarly...in
classic us style, we have a suggestion. This time, it's not just words. This time, it's work itself. We get it. It's not you. It's all
that stuff in your toolbar. They're promising futuristic
features and smarter solutions, but they've made it your
job to connect the dots. Yikes. AI should not be this hard. May we suggest a better option? What if AI worked everywhere you worked? And made everything smarter so
you could rise above the mess. So you and your team can get
more done. Like, way more. And not only sound your
best, but work your best, too. That's Coda and Grammarly. We make AI work for you, not

hgIPxuhAAQI,"I think about Grammarly and how it's helped me prepare not just briefs, but really scripts that allow me to step into a presentation and know that I'm saying something with absolute confidence. I'm Alex Diaz. I'm a professional marketer in Seattle. What I call my weekend job, I volunteer with an organization called Key to Change. It's a black le, blackfounded nonprofit focused on music education specifically for children in underserved communities with the goal of not just teaching music, but it's really about developing and supporting them as leaders because I'm moving so fast in the work that I do. Sometimes it takes a minute to think through changing my tone. And I love AI compose because you open it, you write your intention and automatically this paragraph comes out. You have this template that you can play with, add your tone to. AI composed makes it significantly easier to send emails to donors or communicate with the board on what's going on with the organization. Grammarly allows me to take a step back and say, is this really the clearest message you're getting across? And so with Rewrite for clarity, it's able to expand here's what you're trying to say and why. I just wouldn't have thought about it at the time. Grammarly is very much how do we empower and give you confidence that whatever you're creating, whatever you're writing, whatever message you're trying to send that you come across as you intend.

I'm a product marketer who's interested in how do I bring the voice of a user into the work that we do. Grammarly is just this amazing partner.

Grammarly's AI Compose can help me narrow down what to write about while preserving my authentic voice as a writer.

Whatever you're creating, whatever you're writing, whatever message you're trying to send, you can do it with a smile on your face and with absolute confidence that it's the right message you want to send.

BI-UOyAZCY0,"Grammarly helps me get the best grades possible while depleting the least amount of hours of my week. I'm Lauren Taylor. I'm a student in Future CMO and I am a Grammarly user. So, when I first got Grammarly, my mom got it for me my junior year of high school to help me with my college application essays. But now, it's kind of cool because it's evolved as a platform. Grammarly's AI Compose can help me narrow down what to write about. I can in 15 20 minutes have a decent outline of what I'm going to be writing over the next week or two. It's nice to have a tool that can improve my productivity. Once I've fully fleshed out a draft, I use Grammarly to start looking at clarity and precision. It can tell me things like add more direct quotes if maybe it's gotten a little stale. As a median journalism student, the integrity of my writing is super important. One of Grammarly's best features is the AI and plagiarism detector. If I quote someone a little too closely, Grammarly can pull that article for me and help me create the citation, which just keeps me honest about who I'm sourcing for information. Other platforms are a little more general. They can serve as search engines. They can kind of edit things. They can kind of site things, but they're a little too general to be truly great. Grammarly is a lot more tailored with writers in mind, with creators in mind, with communicators in mind. If as a student you want to put your best foot forward, Grammarly is your go-to.
